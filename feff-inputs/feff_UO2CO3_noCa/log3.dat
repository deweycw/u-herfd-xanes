 Number of energy points =  90
 Doing FMS for a cluster of  15 atoms around iph =  0
 Please, wait (updates every 20 points) ...
    0   FMS matrix (LUD) at point  20, number of state kets = 142
    0   FMS matrix (LUD) at point  40, number of state kets = 142
    0   FMS matrix (LUD) at point  60, number of state kets = 142
    0   FMS matrix (LUD) at point  80, number of state kets = 142
 Done with module 3: FMS.
